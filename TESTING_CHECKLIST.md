## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### **TEST 1: Large File Upload (Most Important)**
**Purpose:** Verify 10MB limit and compression works

**Steps:**
1. **Prepare a large image file** (7-10MB):
   - Take a photo with your phone in high quality
   - Or download a large image from internet
   - Or create a large scan (JPG/PNG)

2. **Login as agent** (kishan@gmail.com or any agent account)

3. **Go to "Submit Application for Student"** form

4. **Upload the large file** (7-10MB) as any document type

5. **Watch console logs** - You should see:
   ```
   🔧 Optimizing file: filename.jpg (8.50MB)
   📊 Original image: 8.50MB, 4000x3000, format: jpeg
   📊 Compressed attempt 1: 0.85MB with quality 70
   ✅ Optimal compression achieved: 850KB
   💾 File optimized: 8.50MB → 0.85MB (saved 90.0%)
   ```

6. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ Upload succeeds (no "file too large" error)
   - ✅ Upload completes in reasonable time (5-15 seconds)
   - ✅ File appears in uploaded documents list
   - ✅ File size shown is ~500KB-1MB (compressed size)
   - ✅ Click to preview/download works
   - ✅ Image quality still readable (not pixelated)

---

### **TEST 2: Multiple File Uploads (Rate Limit)**
**Purpose:** Verify no "Upload limit exceeded" error

**Steps:**
1. **Login as agent**

2. **Upload 20+ documents rapidly** in quick succession:
   - Upload document 1
   - Upload document 2
   - ...continue until 20+ uploads

3. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ No "Upload limit exceeded" error
   - ✅ All uploads succeed
   - ✅ Can continue uploading indefinitely

4. **Previously:** Would get error after 20 uploads
   - Now: Should work up to 1000 uploads/hour

---

### **TEST 3: Different File Types**
**Purpose:** Verify compression works for all image types

**Steps:**
1. **Upload a JPEG** (passport photo)
   - Expected: Compressed if >500KB

2. **Upload a PNG** (scanned document)
   - Expected: Converted to optimized JPEG or WebP

3. **Upload a PDF** (marksheet)
   - Expected: Passed through without compression (PDFs not compressed)

4. **Upload a WebP**
   - Expected: Optimized if >500KB

---

### **TEST 4: Small File Upload**
**Purpose:** Verify small files don't get unnecessarily compressed

**Steps:**
1. **Upload a file <500KB** (e.g., small passport photo)

2. **Watch console:**
   ```
   ✅ Image already small, skipping compression
   ```

3. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ No compression applied
   - ✅ Fast upload

---

### **TEST 5: Multiple Applications (Agent Workflow)**
**Purpose:** Verify agent can create multiple applications without hitting limits

**Steps:**
1. **Login as agent**

2. **Create application 1** for student A:
   - Fill all fields
   - Upload 5-6 documents
   - Submit successfully

3. **Create application 2** for student B:
   - Upload 5-6 documents
   - Submit successfully

4. **Create application 3** for student C:
   - Upload 5-6 documents
   - Submit successfully

5. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ All 3 applications created successfully
   - ✅ Total ~15-18 uploads without issues
   - ✅ No rate limit errors

---

### **TEST 6: Image Quality Check**
**Purpose:** Verify compressed images maintain readability

**Steps:**
1. **Upload a high-quality document** (8-10MB):
   - Aadhar card (both sides together)
   - Marksheet with text
   - Certificate with signatures

2. **After upload:**
   - Download the uploaded file
   - Compare with original

3. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ Text is still readable
   - ✅ Signatures are visible
   - ✅ No significant blurriness
   - ✅ Colors accurate (not washed out)

---

### **TEST 7: Frontend File Size Validation**
**Purpose:** Verify frontend allows 10MB uploads

**Steps:**
1. **Go to upload form**

2. **Check file input:** Should accept up to 10MB

3. **Try uploading 8MB file:**
   - Expected: Accepted, no "file too large" error

4. **Try uploading 11MB file:**
   - Expected: Frontend validation error

---

### **TEST 8: Storage Verification**
**Purpose:** Verify Cloudinary storage is actually reduced

**Steps:**
1. **Upload a 9MB image**

2. **Check backend logs** for optimization stats:
   ```
   optimization: {
     originalSize: 9437184,      // 9MB
     compressedSize: 819200,     // 800KB
     savingsPercent: 91.3,
     cloudinarySize: 820000
   }
   ```

3. **Go to Cloudinary dashboard**
   - Check storage used
   - Compare with pre-optimization

4. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ Storage used is ~80-90% less
   - ✅ File sizes in Cloudinary are 500KB-1MB

---

### **TEST 9: Edge Cases**

#### 9a. **Very Large Dimensions**
- **Upload:** Image with 3000x4000 pixels
- **Expected:** Automatically resized to max 2000px
- **Console:** Should show resize operation

#### 9b. **Failed Compression**
- **Upload:** Corrupted/unsupported file
- **Expected:** Falls back to original, upload still succeeds
- **Console:** "Returning original image due to compression error"

#### 9c. **Multiple Large Files Simultaneously**
- **Upload:** 5 files of 8MB each simultaneously
- **Expected:** All compress and upload successfully
- **Time:** Should complete in <1 minute total

---

### **TEST 10: Performance Check**

**Steps:**
1. **Measure upload time for 8MB file:**
   - Without compression: ~15-20 seconds
   - With compression: ~20-25 seconds (compression + upload)
   - Expected: Slightly slower but acceptable

2. **Compare total data transferred:**
   - Original: 8MB
   - After compression: 0.8MB
   - Expected: 90% bandwidth saved

## 🐛 What to Watch For (Potential Issues)

### ❌ **Errors to Report:**

1. **"Upload failed: Upload limit exceeded"**
   - **Issue:** Rate limit still too low
   - **Fix:** Check rate limit configuration

2. **"File too large" with <10MB file**
   - **Issue:** Frontend validation mismatch
   - **Fix:** Check frontend maxSize settings

3. **Images become pixelated/blurry**
   - **Issue:** Compression too aggressive
   - **Fix:** Adjust quality thresholds in fileCompression.js

4. **Upload hangs/never completes**
   - **Issue:** Sharp library error or Cloudinary issue
   - **Fix:** Check console for error messages

5. **PDF files get corrupted**
   - **Issue:** PDFs getting compressed
   - **Fix:** Verify PDF mimetype check in compression

6. **Memory errors/process crashes**
   - **Issue:** Large files consuming too much memory
   - **Fix:** Check server memory limits

---
