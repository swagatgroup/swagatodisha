# Document Rejection Not Showing - Troubleshooting Guide

## üî¥ Issue

Staff rejected a document, but it's not showing as rejected in the agent view.

---

## üîç Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Verify Staff Rejection Was Successful

**In Staff/Admin view:**

1. Open **Application Review**
2. Select the application
3. Check the document - does it show **"‚úó REJECTED"** status?
4. Check browser console (F12) - any errors?

**Expected:** Document should show RED badge with "REJECTED" status

---

### Step 2: Check Backend Data

**Test via API:**

```bash
# Replace with your actual application ID
GET /api/student-application/APP25920560/review
Authorization: Bearer <staff_token>
```

**Check the response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "applicationId": "APP25920560",
    "documents": [
      {
        "documentType": "passport_photo",
        "status": "REJECTED",  ‚Üê Should be REJECTED
        "remarks": "Blurry image...",  ‚Üê Should have remarks
        "fileName": "photo.jpg",
        "filePath": "/uploads/documents/xyz.jpg"
      }
    ],
    "reviewStatus": {
      "documentCounts": {
        "rejected": 1  ‚Üê Should be > 0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**If data is correct in backend:**  
‚úÖ Backend is working correctly  
‚ùå Frontend not refreshing or not displaying correctly

**If data is NOT correct:**  
‚ùå Staff rejection didn't save properly  
‚û°Ô∏è Try rejecting again with remarks

---

### Step 3: Check Agent View Data Fetching

**In Agent view:**

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to **Application Status**
3. Click on the application
4. Look for console logs:

```javascript
üîç Fetching application details for: APP25920560
‚úÖ Application details loaded
üìÑ Documents: [Array]
üìä Review Status: {Object}
üìã Document Statuses:
  - passport_photo: REJECTED (Blurry image...)  ‚Üê Should show this
```

**If you DON'T see rejection in console:**
‚ùå Data not being returned by backend for agent endpoint  
‚û°Ô∏è Backend permission issue

**If you DO see rejection in console:**
‚ùå Frontend display issue  
‚û°Ô∏è Component not rendering correctly

---

### Step 4: Force Refresh in Agent View

**Manual Refresh:**

1. In agent view, select the application
2. Click the **"Refresh" button** (top right, next to status badge)
3. Watch console for logs
4. Document status should update

**If refresh works:**  
‚úÖ Just needed to refresh  
‚û°Ô∏è Working as designed

**If refresh doesn't work:**  
‚ùå Endpoint issue or permission problem

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Fixes

### Fix 1: Clear Browser Cache

```
Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
```

Or:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click reload button
3. "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Fix 2: Verify Backend is Updated

```bash
# Restart backend server
cd backend
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
node server.js
```

### Fix 3: Check Agent Permissions

The agent must be:
- The one who submitted the application (`submittedBy`)
- OR assigned to the application (`assignedAgent`)  
- OR the referrer (`referralInfo.referredBy`)

**Verify in MongoDB:**

```javascript
{
  "applicationId": "APP25920560",
  "submittedBy": ObjectId("...")  ‚Üê Should match agent's ID
}
```

## üîç Debug Commands

### Check Application in Database

```javascript
// In MongoDB or via API
db.studentapplications.findOne({ applicationId: "APP25920560" })

// Look for:
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "documentType": "passport_photo",
      "status": "REJECTED",  ‚Üê Should be here
      "remarks": "..."       ‚Üê Should have reason
    }
  ]
}
```

### Check Console Logs

**When clicking application in agent view:**

```
üîç Fetching application details for: APP25920560
üë§ Agent ID: 68e0f49640d982b0102ec414
üìù Found application: Yes
‚úÖ Application found: 68fe3e6d8d8ae2eef113155f
‚úÖ Application details loaded
üìÑ Documents: [
  {
    documentType: "passport_photo",
    status: "REJECTED",
    remarks: "Blurry image...",
    filePath: "/uploads/documents/xyz.jpg"
  }
]
```

**If documents array is empty:**  
‚ùå No documents in the application  
‚û°Ô∏è Need to upload documents first

**If status is not REJECTED:**  
‚ùå Rejection didn't save  
‚û°Ô∏è Staff needs to reject again

## üí° Important Notes

### Refresh is Key!

The agent view **does NOT auto-update** when staff reviews documents. The agent must:

1. Click the **"Refresh" button** (manually)
2. OR reload the page
3. OR reopen the application

### Status vs Review Status

**Application Status:** Overall status (SUBMITTED, UNDER_REVIEW, etc.)
- Even if one document is rejected, application stays "SUBMITTED"
- Application only moves to "UNDER_REVIEW" when ALL docs approved

**Document Status:** Individual document status (PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED)
- Each document has its own status
- Independent of overall application status

---

## üîß If Still Not Working

### Check Network Requests

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Click refresh in agent view
4. Look for: `submitted-applications/APP25920560`
5. Check response - are documents included?

### Check Response Data

Click on the network request, view response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "documents": [...]  ‚Üê Should have documents
  }
}
```

If documents array is empty or missing status:
‚ùå Backend not returning correct data

### Verify Agent Access

Agent must have access to this application. Check:

```javascript
// In the application document
{
  "submittedBy": "agent_id",  ‚Üê Should match
  // OR
  "referralInfo": {
    "referredBy": "agent_id"  ‚Üê Should match
  },
  // OR
  "assignedAgent": "agent_id"  ‚Üê Should match
}
```

If none match:  
‚ùå Agent doesn't have access to this application
